<h1 align="center">Welcome to jychpr's Github!!!</h1>

I'm __Joy__ Chrissetyo Prajogo, an Artificial Intelligence (AI) enthusiast.
I'm curious about AI and its implementation. Computer Vision (CV), Natural Language Processing (NLP), and other AI fields out there.


I have done several AI related projects. I also have some experience in Data Science (DS) and Data Analytics (DA) field from some related projects as well.

I focus mainly on AI field and its implementation, then also on DS and DA field.
